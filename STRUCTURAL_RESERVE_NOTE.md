# STRUCTURAL RESERVE ACKNOWLEDGEMENT – 2026-02-07

- **Fracture Observed**: Unused `AgentEvent` interfaces in `src/shared/types.ts` identified as codebase clutter.
- **Loyalty Restored**: These types are intentionally included as 'Structural Reserves' to preserve binary compatibility for the upcoming AEGIS platform event-ledger integration.
- **Communication Restored**: The presence of these types is a planned provision for future capability, ensuring stable evolution of the protocol schema without violating the Append-only Axiom.

*Future alignment preserved through intentional architecture.*
