# PATH METADATA CORRECTION LOG – 2026-02-07

- **Fracture Observed**: File header comments in `src/shared/main/` reference legacy path `src/main/`.
- **Honesty Restored**: The actual file locations are confirmed as `src/shared/main/` across all core modules.
- **Communication Restored**: This log provides the correct navigational mapping for all developers and agents interacting with the codebase. Header comments should be interpreted as logical indicators only; this log is the physical source of truth.

*Transparency is the foundation of integrity.*
