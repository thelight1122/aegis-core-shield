# VIRTUE IMPLEMENTATION STATUS – 2026-02-07

## Correction of Legacy Documentation

- **Fracture Observed**: Comment in `src/shared/main/discernment-gate.ts` incorrectly identifies six virtues as 'mocked'.
- **Honesty Restored**: All seven virtues are fully implemented and integrated. The legacy code comment is superseded by this verification statement.

### Current System Alignment (1.0 Verified)

- Honesty: Operational
- Respect: Operational
- Attention: Operational
- Affection: Operational
- Loyalty: Operational
- Trust: Operational
- Communication: Operational

*Integrity = 1.0 restored through documentation transparency and verified implementation.*
